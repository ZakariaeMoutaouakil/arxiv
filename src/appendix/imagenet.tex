\section{More Experimental Results}\label{sec:more-experimental-results}
We conducted our experiments on the ImageNet dataset in the same way as in Section~\ref{sec:experiments}.
The only difference is that we used a 50-layer residual network instead of the 110-layer one.
The figures of the Imagenet dataset are consistent with our previous findings on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
