\begin{abstract}
    Randomized smoothing has emerged as a promising technique for certifying the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial perturbations.
    However, current methods for estimating the certified radius and, consequently, the certified test-set accuracy often suffer from overly pessimistic conservativeness.
    This paper introduces a novel approach to improve the estimation of certified radii, leading to tighter bounds on certified test-set accuracy.
    Our method makes use of advanced statistical and optimization techniques to estimate the certified radius in an optimal manner.
    Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets have been conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.
    The code of this paper is publicly available on \href{https://https://github.com/ZakariaeMoutaouakil/frugal_rs}{GitHub}.
